Loughborough Soccer Passing Test Calculator
A lightweight calculator for computing official scores for the Loughborough Soccer Passing Test (LSPT) — a validated assessment of soccer passing accuracy, speed, and decision-making under pressure.

⚽ About the LSPT
The LSPT challenges players to:
- Pass accurately to marked benches
- Stay within a restricted area
- Complete the circuit quickly while avoiding penalties

The final score = completion time adjusted by penalties and bonuses.
Lower final score = better performance.
